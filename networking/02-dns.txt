ping google --> this will no result
we need to add the ip in /etc/hosts file

managing all dns records in local is difficult so DNS server came into picture
we need to edit /etc/resolv.conf and add nameserver <nameserver-ip-addr>

by default local host file has higher priority than DNS server

we can change that by changing the order, hosts:          files dns

We can add in DNS server Forward All to 8.8.8.8 so all unknow urls can be reloved by google dns

If we add the following in resolv.conf,
search mycompany.com

then ping app, will resolve to app.mycompany.com

DNS records,

A is for ipv4 to name
AAAA is for ipv6 to name
CNAME is for name to name
